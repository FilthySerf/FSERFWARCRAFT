----------

Combines all your hearthstones and flightmaster's whistle into a single button. Unfortunately it doesn't help your bag space. 

Replace the first Hearthstone with whatever toy hearthstone you want such as Eternal Traveller's Hearthstone or Astral Recall for shamans.

If using astral Recall see below:
