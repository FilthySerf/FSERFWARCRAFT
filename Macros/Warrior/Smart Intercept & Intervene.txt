/cast [@mouseover,exists,nodead,nohelp][@target,exists,nodead,nohelp] Charge
/cast [@mouseover,exists,nodead,help][@target,exists,nodead,help] Intervene

This will change dynamically based on conditionals.

IF a mouseover is present, it's not dead, and it's not friendly, Charge. 
ELSE IF a target is present, it's not dead, and it's not friendly, Charge. 
ELSE IF a mouseover is present, it's not dead, and it's friendly, Intervene. 
ELSE IF a target is present, it's not dead, and it's friendly, Intervene.
ELSE does nothing.

This macro WILL react on the first true condition.
