/use [combat] Brazier of Awakening;
/cast [nomod] Resuscitate; [mod:shift] Reawaken;


------

During Combat:
Brazier of Awakening is available to put down for a single target end of combat revive (if you have the item, if not it'll show the icon but greyed out)
Outside of Combat:
Single Target Revive, or Group if you hold Shift.

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE BRAZIER OF AWAKENING I HAVE A DUMBED DOWN VERSION BELOW THOUGH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING THE TOY FROM TANAAN JUNGLE:
